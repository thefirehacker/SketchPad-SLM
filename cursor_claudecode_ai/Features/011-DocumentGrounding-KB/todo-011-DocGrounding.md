## âœ… **CRITICAL BUGS RESOLVED** 

### **Issue A: Document Filtering Bypass** (Priority: **RESOLVED** âœ…)
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - User confirmed document filtering works correctly  
**Root Cause**: DataInspector was receiving ALL 11 documents instead of userdocs only  
**Solution**: Document filtering mechanism now working properly with DataInspector magic filtering  
**Result**: DataInspector correctly receives only userdocs (2-3 documents vs previous 11)

**Tasks**:
- [x] **A.1**: Document filtering system confirmed working âœ…
- [x] **A.2**: DataInspector magic filtering operational âœ…
- [x] **A.3**: User verification completed âœ…
- [x] **A.4**: No regression in existing functionality âœ…

### **Issue B: UI Progress Visibility Gap** (Priority: **RESOLVED** âœ…)
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive progress history system implemented for all agents  
**Evidence**: All agents now show expandable progress history with timestamps and detailed workflow visibility  
**Impact**: Excellent user experience with complete transparency into multi-agent operations

**Tasks**:
- [x] **B.1**: âœ… Stream detailed progress from DataInspector to UI
- [x] **B.2**: âœ… Replace generic loading with real-time agent status display  
- [x] **B.3**: âœ… Show document analysis progress with cumulative history and timestamps
- [x] **B.4**: âœ… Display current agent operations and substeps with collapsible UI
- [x] **B.5**: âœ… Implement progress updates for all agents in pipeline (DataInspector, PlanningAgent, PatternGeneratorAgent)
- [x] **B.6**: âœ… **NEW FIX**: Fixed progress history disappearing on completion - research steps now stored per message permanently

### **Issue D: LLM Relevance Detection Override** (Priority: **RESOLVED** âœ…)
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Fixed DataInspector incorrectly overriding LLM relevance decisions  
**Root Cause**: Relevance detection logic assumed all queries were person-specific, incorrectly filtering out relevant documents for topic-based queries  
**Solution**: Removed hardcoded topic keyword detection and now trusts LLM judgment completely except for explicit person-specific queries  
**Result**: System now works for any query variation while maintaining person-specific filtering accuracy

**Tasks**:
- [x] **D.1**: âœ… Identified root cause of "0 relevant documents" issue for topic queries
- [x] **D.2**: âœ… Fixed relevance detection to trust LLM judgment for non-person queries  
- [x] **D.3**: âœ… Removed hardcoded keyword lists to prevent future query variations from failing
- [x] **D.4**: âœ… Maintained person-specific filtering for queries like "Tyler's blog posts" 
- [x] **D.5**: âœ… Applied principle: "No hardcoding, no fallbacks - LLM intelligence is trusted"

### **Issue E: Insufficient Chunk Sampling Strategy** (Priority: **RESOLVED** âœ…)
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Enhanced chunk sampling from 2 chunks max to 30% or minimum 5 chunks with smart distribution  
**Root Cause**: Limited sampling severely restricted document understanding (60-chunk document â†’ only 2 chunks = 3.3% coverage)  
**Solution**: Implemented user's algorithm with smart distribution (first + last + evenly distributed middle chunks)  
**Result**: 9x improvement in content coverage - 60-chunk document now gets 18 chunks (30% coverage)

**Tasks**:
- [x] **E.1**: âœ… Analyzed chunk sampling bottleneck (2 chunks max regardless of document size)
- [x] **E.2**: âœ… Implemented 30% or minimum 5 chunks algorithm 
- [x] **E.3**: âœ… Added smart distribution strategy (first + last + middle chunks)
- [x] **E.4**: âœ… Increased content per chunk from 400 to 800 characters
- [x] **E.5**: âœ… Preserved existing chunk metadata and indexing logic

### **Issue F: Pattern Generator Missing Document-Specific Terms** (Priority: **RESOLVED** âœ…)
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Enhanced PatternGenerator with content-aware term extraction and pattern generation  
**Root Cause**: Pattern generation ignored actual document content, missing document-specific terms like "GRPO"  
**Solution**: Added document-specific term extraction and content-aware pattern generation  
**Result**: PatternGenerator now extracts and generates patterns for document-specific terms

**Tasks**:
- [x] **F.1**: âœ… Added extractDocumentTerms() method for LLM-based term extraction
- [x] **F.2**: âœ… Enhanced pattern generation with document-specific terms + query intent
- [x] **F.3**: âœ… Created createContentAwarePrompt() for combining content analysis
- [x] **F.4**: âœ… Increased chunk analysis from 5 to 8 chunks with 600 characters each
- [x] **F.5**: âœ… Ensured zero hardcoding while improving content awareness

### **Issue G: Response Format and Direct Question Answering** (Priority: **RESOLVED** âœ…)
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Added ResponseFormatterAgent to ensure direct question answering with clear formatting  
**Root Cause**: Synthesis provided good content but didn't directly answer user questions with optimal formatting  
**Solution**: Created ResponseFormatterAgent that runs after Synthesizer to enhance response formatting  
**Result**: Responses now directly address user questions with professional formatting and improved readability

**Tasks**:
- [x] **G.1**: âœ… Created ResponseFormatterAgent with LLM-based response enhancement
- [x] **G.2**: âœ… Implemented direct question answering capability
- [x] **G.3**: âœ… Added clear formatting (headers, bullet points, emphasis) while preserving content
- [x] **G.4**: âœ… Integrated quality scoring and improvement tracking
- [x] **G.5**: âœ… Registered agent in orchestration pipeline after Synthesizer

### **Issue C: LLM Calling Non-Existent WebSearchAgent** (Priority: **RESOLVED** âœ…)
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Dynamic agent registry system implemented in current session  
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded tool lists in Orchestrator prompt template always showed WebSearchAgent as available  
**Solution**: Replaced all hardcoded agent lists with dynamic registry-based lists  
**Result**: LLM now only sees and calls agents that are actually registered in the system

**Tasks**:
- [x] **C.1**: Created `buildDynamicToolsList()` method for dynamic tool list generation âœ…
- [x] **C.2**: Updated prompt templates to only show registered agents âœ…
- [x] **C.3**: Fixed `agentsNotCalled`, `priorityOrder`, and `TOOL_NAME` format templates âœ…
- [x] **C.4**: Added conditional WebSearchAgent fallback options âœ…
- [x] **C.5**: Resolved TypeScript linting errors âœ…
